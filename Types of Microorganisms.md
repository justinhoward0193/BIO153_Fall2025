## **Typically, microbes are unicellular and small enough to require something such as a microscope to see**

## Some unicellular microbes are visible to the naked eye, and some multicellular organisms that are microscopic

# The size of an object needs to be approximately 100 micrometers (µm) to be visible without a microscope, but most microbial life is smaller

## For some perspective, consider that a typical animal cell measures roughly 10 µm across but is still microscopic (human egg can be seen with naked eye, supposedly)

# Units of Length Commonly Used in Microbiology



| Metric Unit   | Meaning of Prefix | Metric Equivalent              |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| meter (m)     | -                 | 1 m = 100 m                    |
| decimeter (dm)| 1/10              | 1 dm = 0.1 m = 10^-1 m         |
| centimeter (cm)| 1/100            | 1 cm = 0.01 m = 10^-2 m        |
| millimeter (mm)| 1/1000           | 1 mm = 0.001 m = 10^-3 m       |
| micrometer (µm)| 1/1,000,000      | 1 µm = 0.000001 m = 10^-6 m    |
| nanometer (nm) | 1/1,000,000,000  | 1 nm = 0.000000001 m = 10^-9 m |

### Microorganisms vary not just in size, but with structure, habitat, metabolism, and many other characteristics

# Microbes are found in all domains of life: **Archaea**, **Bacteria**, and **Eukarya**

---



- ## Bacteria and Archaea are all prokaryotes (cells lack a nucleus). 
- ## Some common bacterial shapes include bacillus, coccus, vibrio etc. 

- ## Eukarya are eukaryotes (their cells have a nucleus)

- ## Viruses do not fit in any domain of life






---
 
![shapes bg fit](unit1images/Fig1.13.jpg)

---

## **Archaea** and **bacteria** have different evolutionary histories, as well as significant differences in genetics, metabolic pathways, and the composition of their cell walls and membranes. 

- ## Unlike most bacteria, archaeal cell walls do not contain peptidoglycan
- ## Archaea are ubiquitous, found in extreme environments
- ## Some archaea live in the human body

## Eukaryotic Microorganisms

## The domain Eukarya contains all eukaryotes, including uni- or multicellular eukaryotes such as protists, fungi, plants, and animals. 

# The major defining characteristic of eukaryotes is that their cells contain a nucleus.

---

## Protists are an informal grouping of eukaryotes that no one really knows how to classify.

## We are comfortable with classifying something as a **plant, animal, or fungus.** 

---

  ## **Algae** are a group of photosynthetic protists. 

## Algae include a wide range of organisms, from microscopic single-celled species to large seaweeds.

## Green algae (such as *Chlamydomonas* and *Spirogyra*) and brown algae (such as kelp) are examples of photosynthetic protists.

---

## Algal protists are surrounded by cell walls made of cellulose, a type of carbohydrate.


## **Agar** is a gel derived from algae, can be mixed with various nutrients and used to grow microorganisms in a Petri dish. 


---

## Cyanobacteria is type of bacteria, is also considered an algae.

## These organisms are bacterial prokaryotes and **therefore have a peptidoglycan-based cell wall**, unlike the cellulose-based cell wall of the algal protists.

---

![Assorted diatomes bg right](unit1images/Fig1.15.jpg)
## Assorted diatoms, a kind of algae. 

---

## Protozoa (singular: protozoan) are protists that make up the backbone of many food webs by providing nutrients for other organisms. 

---

## Protozoa are diverse and move with help from hair-like structures called **cilia** or whip-like structures called **flagella**

![paramecium bg left contain](unit1images/360px-Paramecium_diagram.png)

---


## Others extend part of their cell membrane and cytoplasm to propel themselves forward. These cytoplasmic extensions are called **pseudopods** (false feet). 

---

![phagocytosis bg contain](unit1images/Phagocytosis_--_amoeba.jpg)

---

![neutrophil eating anthrax bg](unit1images/Neutrophil_with_anthrax_copy.jpg)

---

- Some protozoa are photosynthetic
- Some feed on organic material. 
- Some are free-living
- Some are parasitic
- A few are pathogens that can cause disease in animals or humans (e.g., *Giardia lamblia*)

![giardia bg right](unit1images/Fig1.16.jpg)

---

## Fungi (singular: fungus) are also eukaryotes. 


- ## Fungi are not photosynthetic
- ## Fungi cell walls are usually made out of **chitin** rather than **cellulose.**
  
---

 # Yeasts are single cell fungus
 
With more than 1000 known species and found in the deep sea to the human navel. 

---

## Some yeasts are beneficial with making bread and beer

## Some even cause diseases, such as vaginal yeast infections and oral thrush (e.g., *Candida albicans* is a unicellular fungus a.k.a. yeast)

![alt text bg left contain](unit1images/Fig1.17.jpg)

---

# Molds are multicellular fungus. 

## Molds are found in many different environments, from soil to rotting food to dank bathroom corners. 

---

![ bg left ](unit1images/Fig1.18.jpg)
## Molds play a critical role in the decomposition of dead plants and animals.

## Some molds can make you sick with **mycotoxins**.

# **Penicillin** was made from molds.


---

## **Helminths** - Multicellular parasitic worms with microscopic eggs and larvae.

## *Dracunculus medinensis* a.k.a. the guinea worm

### In the mid-1980s, there were an estimated 3.5 million cases of guinea-worm disease.

### In 2014, there were only 126 cases reported, thanks to the coordinated efforts of the World Health Organization (WHO) and other groups committed to improvements in drinking water sanitation.

---

## Parasitic 'worms' are classified under 'helminths' and include things such as **tape worms** and **hook worms.**

## They look like *Annelida* e.g., earth worm, but an earth worm is an animal, so it belongs to **Kingdom Animalia**

---

## Apart from looks, they share no other significant similarity to actual worms. 

## **Helminths** are more of a 'live in your brain' or 'lay an egg your food' type organism, so they are classified with **Kingdom Protista**

# Viruses

Viruses are acellular microorganisms, which means they are not composed of cells. Essentially, a virus consists of proteins and genetic material either DNA or RNA, but never both.

However, by incorporating themselves into a host cell, viruses are able to co-opt the host's cellular mechanisms to multiply and infect other hosts.

Viruses can infect all types of cells, from human cells to the cells of other microorganisms. In humans, viruses are responsible for numerous diseases, from the common cold to deadly Ebola (Figure 1.20). However, many viruses do not cause disease.
