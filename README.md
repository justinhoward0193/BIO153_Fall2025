# Instructor’s Use of AI

In this course, I fully adopt AI tools as part of my teaching practice.  
**AI is like a microscope**—in biology it can reveal patterns and prompt better questions, but the observing, interpreting, and explaining still come from the scientist.

All course materials originate from **textbooks, curated research papers, my personal writing projects, videos, and my teaching library.**  
AI is used to **format, organize, and polish** this material so it is easier to study and apply. Whenever possible, I include **links back to the original source documents** so you can see the foundation behind each resource.

This reflects my professional expertise and deliberate use of AI in teaching.  
**Students should not assume they can copy this approach for their own assignments.** You are responsible for producing your own work and demonstrating your own understanding.

### Expectations for Student Work

- **Original work:** Submitting unedited AI output as your own may constitute academic dishonesty.  
- **Verification & citation:** You remain responsible for accuracy and for citing legitimate sources.  
- **Privacy:** Do not upload exam prompts, unpublished data, or classmates’ work into public tools.  

The instructor may require drafts, process evidence, or oral checks to verify your understanding.  
Misuse will be handled under **KCTCS academic integrity policies**.
